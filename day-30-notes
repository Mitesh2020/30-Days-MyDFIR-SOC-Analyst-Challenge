# Troubleshooting 30-Day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge | Day 30

## Objective:

Troubleshoot common issues encountered during the 30-day MyDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, particularly related to Kibana, Elastic Agent, osTicket, and webhook integration.

## Common Issues & Resolutions:

### 1. Kibana Connection Error

**Symptoms:** Kibana dashboard is not loading or inaccessible.
**Possible Fixes:**

* Ensure Elasticsearch and Kibana services are running.
* Verify network connectivity between browser and Elasticsearch VM.
* Check if the correct port (5601) is open and accessible.

### 2. Fleet Server Failed - Timed Out

**Symptoms:** Fleet server setup fails during Elastic Agent enrollment.
**Possible Fixes:**

* Confirm Elasticsearch and Kibana are fully initialized.
* Ensure Fleet server host IP is correctly set in Fleet settings.
* Open required ports (8220 for Fleet, 5601 for Kibana).

### 3. Fail to Execute Request to Fleet Server

**Symptoms:** Elastic Agent fails to communicate with Fleet server.
**Possible Fixes:**

* Recheck Fleet server URL in agent installation script.
* Ensure firewall rules allow communication.
* Restart the agent and Fleet server.

### 4. x509 Certificate Signed by Unknown Authority

**Symptoms:** TLS/SSL certificate issues during secure communication setup.
**Possible Fixes:**

* Use `--insecure` flag when installing Elastic Agent in lab environment.
* Ensure correct CA certificate is in use.
* For production, use valid and signed certificates.

### 5. Cannot Connect - Invalid Settings (osTicket)

**Symptoms:** Kibana unable to send alerts to osTicket via webhook.
**Possible Fixes:**

* Recheck osTicket API URL: `http://<windows-server-ip>/osTicket/upload/api/tickets.xml`
* Verify the API key and IP address match in osTicket settings.
* Ensure port 80 is open and reachable.

### 6. Error Calling Webhook Request Failed

**Symptoms:** Webhook connector in Kibana fails to trigger alerts.
**Possible Fixes:**

* Test the webhook with sample payload (from osTicket GitHub API docs).
* Validate that the content type and headers (especially `X-API-KEY`) are correct.
* Ensure osTicket server is reachable from Kibana/Elastic instance.
