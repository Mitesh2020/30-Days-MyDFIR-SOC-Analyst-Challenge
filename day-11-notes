# 🛡️ What is a Brute Force Attack? | Day 11

## 🎯 Objective

Understand what **brute force attacks** are, explore their types, learn about common tools used, and discover how to protect yourself from such attacks.



## 🔐 What is a Brute Force Attack?

A **brute force attack** is a trial-and-error method used to **guess login credentials, encryption keys, or hidden data** by systematically trying every possible combination until the correct one is found.

It is one of the oldest and most basic forms of cyberattacks, often used to compromise weak or reused passwords.



## 📚 Types of Brute Force Attacks

### 1. 🔠 Standard Brute Force
- Attempts **all possible combinations** of characters.
- Can take a long time depending on password complexity.

### 2. 📖 Dictionary Attack
- Uses a **predefined wordlist** of commonly used passwords or phrases.
- Faster than standard brute force but limited to known or leaked credentials.
- Often combined with **credential dumping** and password reuse tactics.

### 3. 🔄 Credential Stuffing
- Involves using **previously leaked credentials** from data breaches.
- Automates login attempts across multiple services to exploit reused credentials.



## 🧪 Common Brute Force Tools

| Tool           | Description                                               |
|-|--|
| **Hydra**      | Fast and flexible network login cracker                   |
| **Hashcat**    | Advanced password recovery tool for cracking hashes       |
| **John the Ripper** | Versatile password cracker used for brute force and dictionary attacks |



## 🛡️ How to Protect Against Brute Force Attacks

1. **Use Long & Complex Passwords**
   - Use passphrases of **15+ characters**
   - Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols

2. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Adds a second layer of protection (OTP, Authenticator app, etc.)

3. **Be Vigilant**
   - Avoid reusing passwords across multiple sites
   - Monitor account activity
   - Change passwords if a service is breached

4. **Account Lockouts & Rate Limiting**
   - Prevent repeated login attempts after several failures

5. **Use CAPTCHA & IP Blacklisting**
   - Stops automated tools from brute-forcing login forms



## 🔍 Real-World Scenarios

- Attackers brute-forcing SSH or RDP credentials on exposed servers
- Credential stuffing on social media or banking platforms using leaked data
- Cracking stolen password hashes from compromised databases



## ✅ Summary

Brute force attacks may be simple, but they are still widely used and **effective against weak security practices**. A combination of **strong authentication**, **good password hygiene**, and **multi-factor protection** is essential to defend against them.
