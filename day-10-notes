# 📥 Elasticsearch Ingest Data Tutorial | Day 10

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to ingest **Sysmon** and **Windows Defender** logs into **Elasticsearch** using the **Fleet + Elastic Agent** integration in Kibana.



## ✅ Prerequisites

- Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Fleet Server running
- Windows Server 2022 with Elastic Agent installed and enrolled in Fleet
- Custom Agent Policy (`windows-policy`) already created



## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide

### 🖥️ Step 1: Log into Kibana

Navigate to your Kibana instance:

```

http\://<your-elasticsearch-vm-ip>:5601

```



### 🔍 Step 2: Add Sysmon Integration

1. Click on **Integrations**
2. Search for **"windows"**
3. Select **Custom Windows Event Logs**
4. Click **"Add Custom Windows Event Logs"**
5. Fill out:
   - **Integration Name**: `win-sysmon`
   - **Description**: `Collect sysmon logs`

6. Find **Channel Name**:
   - On your **Windows Server 2022 VM**:
     - Open **Event Viewer**
     - Navigate to:  
       `Applications and Services Logs → Microsoft → Windows → Sysmon`
     - Right-click **Operational** → **Properties**
     - Copy the **Full Name** (Channel name)

7. Paste this channel name in Kibana
8. Under **"Where to add this integration"**, select:
   - `windows-policy`
9. Click **Save and continue**



### 🛡️ Step 3: Add Windows Defender Integration

Repeat similar steps:

1. Go back to **Integrations**
2. Search for **Windows Defender**
3. Select **Custom Windows Event Logs**
4. Click **"Add Custom Windows Event Logs"**
5. Fill out:
   - **Integration Name**: `win-defender`
   - **Description**: `Collect defender logs`

6. Find **Channel Name**:
   - On the Windows VM:
     - Go to:  
       `Applications and Services Logs → Microsoft → Windows → Windows Defender`
     - Right-click **Operational** → **Properties**
     - Copy the **Full Name**

7. In Kibana, paste the channel name
8. Under **Advanced Options**, set **Event IDs**:
```

1116,1117,5001

````

#### 📘 What These Event IDs Mean:

| Event ID | Description                                                             |
|-|-|
| `1116`   | Malware was detected by Windows Defender                                |
| `1117`   | Malware detection was resolved (e.g., quarantined or removed)           |
| `5001`   | Windows Defender real-time protection feature has been disabled         |

> These logs are valuable for detecting malware activity and changes to endpoint protection status.

9. Under **Where to add this integration**, choose:
- `windows-policy`
10. Click **Save and continue**



## 🔍 Step 4: Verify Log Ingestion

1. In Kibana, go to **Discover**
2. Use the following filters to confirm logs are being received:

- **For Sysmon logs**:
  ```text
  winlog.event_id: 1
  ```

- **For Windows Defender logs**:
  ```text
  winlog.event_id: 5001
  ```



## ⚠️ Important Notes

- 🛑 **Disable Real-Time Protection** on the Windows Server VM to generate Defender logs:
- Go to **Windows Security → Virus & Threat Protection → Manage Settings**
- Toggle **Real-time Protection** off

- 🔁 **Fleet Server must be running**
- Without it, logs from the Windows Server will **not** reach Elasticsearch.
