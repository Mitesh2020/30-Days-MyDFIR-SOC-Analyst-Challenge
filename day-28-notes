# Investigate Mythic Agent | Day 28

## Objective:

Learn how to investigate Mythic C2 telemetry that we generated during the simulation.

## Overview:

This tutorial focuses on analyzing and investigating telemetry data collected from a Mythic Command and Control (C2) session using the Apollo agent. We aim to identify artifacts, commands, and traces left behind during the attacker simulation.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites:

* Working setup of Mythic C2 Framework with Apollo agent.
* Windows Server VM used as the victim machine.
* Elasticsearch & Kibana setup to collect Windows logs via Winlogbeat or similar.
* Previously executed payload on victim and C2 session established.

---

## üîç Investigation Steps:

### 1. **Review the Commands Executed in Mythic**

* Login to Mythic dashboard.
* Go to the "Callbacks" section.
* Select the callback corresponding to the compromised host.
* Review all the commands executed (e.g., `whoami`, `ipconfig`, `net user`, download, etc.).

### 2. **Check Telemetry in Kibana**

* Open Kibana: `http://<elasticsearch-vm-ip>:5601`
* Go to **Discover** tab and run queries based on command execution.

  Example query:

  ```
  event.code : 1 AND winlog.event_data.OriginalFileName : Apollo.exe
  ```
* Look for PowerShell, rundll32, cmd-based telemetry tied to the timeframe when Mythic agent was active.

### 3. **Pivot to Other Related Events**

* Look for related process creation (`event.code:1`), network connection (`event.code:3`), and defender alerts (`event.code:5001`).
* Track how the payload was downloaded (e.g., PowerShell download cradle).
* Investigate if any additional binaries were dropped or if privilege escalation was attempted.

### 4. **Use Kibana Dashboard**

* If a custom dashboard is already created (as done in Day 22), use it to quickly visualize:

  * Parent-child process chains.
  * Network activity.
  * Defender alerts blocked/executed.

### 5. **Cross-reference with Threat Intelligence**

* Use VirusTotal or Hybrid Analysis to scan the Apollo agent binary (if saved).
* Note any suspicious indicators that align with known threat actors or tools.

## ‚úÖ Outcome:

By the end of this investigation, you should:

* Understand how attacker actions leave forensic traces in system logs.
* Know how to identify agent behavior using log correlation.
* Be able to use Mythic + Kibana for both offensive simulation and defensive detection.
