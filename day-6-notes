# 🚀 Elastic Agent and Fleet Server Introduction | Day 6

## 🎯 Objective

Understand what an **Elastic Agent** and **Fleet Server** are, and how they simplify log, metric, and security data collection in the **Elastic Stack**.



## 📦 What is Elastic Agent?

The **Elastic Agent** is a unified, all-in-one agent that:
- Collects **logs**, **metrics**, and **security data**
- Supports **endpoint protection** and **threat prevention**
- Replaces traditional **Beats** (like Filebeat, Metricbeat) by consolidating their capabilities into one installable agent



## ⚙️ Modes of Deployment

Elastic Agent can be deployed in **two modes**:

### 1. 🧠 Managed by Fleet (Recommended)
- Agent is managed centrally using the **Fleet UI** in Kibana
- Policies and configuration are pushed from a central location
- Supports **automatic updates**, **monitoring**, and **scaling**
- Ideal for large-scale environments and dynamic infrastructure

### 2. ⚙️ Standalone Mode
- No centralized management
- All configuration is done **locally** using YAML files
- Offers more **manual control**, but requires more maintenance



## 🔄 Beats vs Elastic Agent

| Feature              | Beats                           | Elastic Agent                     |
|-|-|--|
| Individual Tools     | Separate Beats for each use case | One single binary                 |
| Management           | Manual config per Beat           | Centrally managed via Fleet (optional) |
| Use Cases            | Logs, metrics, etc. per Beat     | Logs, metrics, security, EDR, and more |
| Deployment           | Lightweight, minimal control     | Central control + endpoint security |
| Updates              | Manual per Beat                  | Centralized and automated         |



## 🌐 What is Fleet Server?

The **Fleet Server** is a component of the Elastic Stack that:

- Acts as a **central communication bridge** between Elastic Agents and the Kibana Fleet UI
- Is responsible for:
  - Distributing configuration policies to agents
  - Collecting monitoring status and logs from agents
  - Simplifying onboarding and scaling of agents
- Installed as a separate service and registered to the Elastic Stack



## ✅ Key Benefits

- One agent for everything (versus installing multiple Beats)
- Easier scalability via centralized control
- Better visibility into agent health and status
- Built-in support for **endpoint protection** and **malware prevention**



## 📌 Summary

Elastic Agent and Fleet Server represent the next-generation data collection and endpoint management tools within the Elastic Stack.

- Use **Fleet-managed mode** for centralized control, especially in large environments
- Use **Standalone mode** for maximum flexibility (with more setup)
- Replace Beats with Elastic Agent for modern, scalable observability and security
