# Investigate SSH Brute Force Attack | Day 26

## Objective:

Learn how to investigate an SSH brute force alert using Kibana and raise a support ticket via osTicket.

---

## Steps:

### 1. Navigate to Alerts

* Open Kibana at: `http://your-elasticsearch-vm-ip:5601`
* Go to **Security** -> **Alerts** to view SSH brute force alerts.

---

### 2. Brute Force Investigation Methodology

#### a. Is the IP known to perform brute force activity?

* Check IP reputation using:

  * [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/)
  * [GreyNoise](https://www.greynoise.io/)

#### b. Are other users affected by this IP?

* Go to **Discover** tab in Kibana.
* Use filters:

  * `attacker.ip: <IP>`
  * `user.name: *`

#### c. Were any of them successful?

* Search for successful login attempts:

  ```
  attacker.ip: <IP> AND message: "Accepted"
  ```

#### d. What activity occurred after successful login?

* Investigate user activity logs after the time of successful login.

---

### 3. Configure osTicket Webhook in Rule Settings

* Go to **Security** -> **Rules**
* Select the **SSH Brute Force Rule**
* Click **Edit rule settings** -> Go to **Actions** -> Choose **Webhook**

#### Action Frequency:

* `For each alert`

#### Request Body:

Paste the payload (used earlier in osTicket integration), modify as follows:

* Remove `ip` and `attachments` tags

* Under `name` tag: set any custom name

* Under `subject`: use `{{rule.name}}`

* Under `message`:

  ```
  Please investigate the rule: {{rule.name}}
  ```

* Save the changes

---

### 4. Simulate SSH Brute Force Attack

* Perform brute-force login attempts on the Linux VM
* If the rule is triggered, a ticket will automatically be raised in osTicket

---

## Outcome:

* You can now effectively:

  * Investigate SSH brute force alerts
  * Correlate attacker activity
  * Automate ticket creation in osTicket for security incidents

---

### Tools Used:

* **Kibana (Elastic Security)**
* **osTicket**
* **AbuseIPDB / GreyNoise** for IP intelligence

---

> âœ… This process enables faster triage and response to brute force attacks in a monitored SOC environment.
