# 🖥️ Day 15 - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Introduction

## 🎯 Objective

Understand what **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** is, its common use cases, how attackers exploit it, and how to secure RDP-enabled systems.



## 📘 What is RDP?

- RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is a Microsoft protocol that allows users to connect to another computer over a network connection using a graphical interface.
- Commonly used for **remote administration**, **technical support**, and **remote access**.



## 🔓 How Attackers Abuse RDP

Attackers commonly exploit exposed or poorly secured RDP endpoints to:
- **Brute force** weak passwords
- Deploy **ransomware** or other malware
- Gain **unauthorized access** to internal networks
- Perform **lateral movement** within compromised environments

They often find exposed RDP services using tools like:
- **Shodan**
- **Censys**
- **Masscan**
- **Nmap**



## 🛡️ Best Practices to Secure RDP

1. **Turn off RDP** if not needed.
2. Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for remote access.
3. **Restrict RDP access** using firewalls, VPNs, or IP whitelisting.
4. Enforce **strong, complex passwords**.
5. **Rename or disable default accounts** like "Administrator".



## 🧠 Learnings

- RDP is powerful but can be dangerous if left exposed or misconfigured.
- Awareness of common attacker techniques helps in defending systems.
- Proactive measures can significantly reduce RDP-related risks.
