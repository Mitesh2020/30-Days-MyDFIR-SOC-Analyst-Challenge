# 📦 How To Install Elastic Agent on Ubuntu | Day 13

## 🎯 Objective

Install the **Elastic Agent** on an **Ubuntu Server** and verify its ability to collect logs and detect events like failed SSH login attempts.



## ✅ Prerequisites

- Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Fleet Server set up and running
- Ubuntu Server (22.04 or later)
- Fleet Server accessible from Ubuntu Server IP



## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide

### 🖥️ Step 1: Create an Agent Policy in Kibana

1. Navigate to Kibana in your browser:

```

http\://<your-elasticsearch-vm-ip>:5601

```

2. Go to:

```

Management → Fleet → Agent policies

```

3. Click **Create agent policy**

4. Name the policy:

```

Linux Policy

```

5. Click **Create agent policy**



### 📥 Step 2: Add Elastic Agent to Ubuntu Server

1. Go to:

```

Fleet → Agents → Add agent

````

2. Choose your newly created **Linux Policy**

3. Copy the **Linux TAR command** shown (not DEB or RPM), and run it in your Ubuntu terminal.

Example:

```bash
curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/elastic-agent/elastic-agent-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar xzvf elastic-agent-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd elastic-agent-<version>-linux-x86_64
sudo ./elastic-agent install --url=https://<fleet-server-ip>:8220 --enrollment-token=<your-token> --insecure
````

✅ **Important**: Add `--insecure` at the end of the install command to avoid TLS certificate errors during testing.



### 🧪 Step 3: Verify Elastic Agent is Working

1. Go to **Kibana → Discover**

2. Use the filter:

   ```
   agent.name: "<your-ubuntu-agent-name>"
   ```

This confirms that the agent has been successfully enrolled and is sending data.



### 🔐 Step 4: Simulate an Authentication Failure

From your **Elasticsearch/Kibana VM**, try to SSH into your Ubuntu Server using wrong credentials:

```bash
ssh wronguser@<ubuntu-vm-ip>
```



### 🔍 Step 5: Check for Authentication Failure Log

1. Go to **Discover** in Kibana

2. Use the filter:

   ```text
   host.ip: "<ubuntu-vm-ip>" AND message: "authentication failure"
   ```

If everything is working, you will see logs related to failed login attempts.
