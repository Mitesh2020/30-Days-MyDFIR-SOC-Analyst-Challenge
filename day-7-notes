# 🚀 Elastic Agent and Fleet Server Setup Tutorial | Day 7

## 🎯 Objective

1. Install the **Elastic Agent** on a **Windows Server**
2. Enroll the Windows Server into the **Fleet Server** for centralized management



## 🛠️ Setup Overview

We will:
- Set up a **Fleet Server** on an Ubuntu VM
- Enroll a **Windows Server 2022 VM** (configured in Day 5) using Elastic Agent
- Manage all configurations through the **Fleet UI in Kibana**



## 📌 Prerequisites

- ✅ Elasticsearch and Kibana already installed and running
- ✅ Ubuntu VM to act as the **Fleet Server**
- ✅ Windows Server 2022 VM with RDP access
- ✅ Internet access on both machines



## 🔧 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 🖥️ Step 1: Set Up Fleet Server on Ubuntu

1. SSH into your **Ubuntu VM**
2. Open a browser and visit:

```text
http://<your-elasticsearch-vm-ip>:5601
````

3. Navigate to:

```
Management → Fleet → Add Fleet Server
```

4. Under **Quick Start**, provide the following:

```
Fleet Server name: <any-name>
Fleet Server host URL: https://<fleet-server-ip>:8220
```

> Note: Use the IP address of your Ubuntu VM as `<fleet-server-ip>`



### 🧾 Step 2: Install Fleet Server on Ubuntu

1. Copy the **Linux command** generated in the Fleet UI
2. Paste it into your **Ubuntu Fleet VM** terminal
3. When prompted, type `Y` to confirm and install the **Elastic Agent**

> This turns your Ubuntu machine into a Fleet Server and connects it to Kibana.



### 🪟 Step 3: Enroll Windows Server into Fleet

1. Go back to the **Kibana UI → Fleet → Agents**
2. Click **Add agent**
3. Create or select a **Custom Agent Policy** (e.g., `Windows Monitoring Policy`)
4. Copy the **Windows command** shown in Kibana
5. On your **Windows Server 2022 VM**:

   * Open **PowerShell as Administrator**
   * Paste the command and run it
   * Confirm installation by typing `Y` when prompted

> This installs the Elastic Agent and enrolls the Windows Server into the Fleet UI.



## ✅ Post-Setup Verification

* Go back to **Fleet → Agents** in Kibana
* You should see the Windows Server VM listed as **online**
* It should be assigned to the custom policy you created



## 📌 Summary

| Component      | Action                            |
| -- |  |
| Ubuntu VM      | Acts as Fleet Server              |
| Kibana UI      | Used for agent enrollment         |
| Windows Server | Enrolled using Elastic Agent CLI  |
| Fleet          | Centralized policy & data control |



## 📚 Additional Tips

* Use **HTTPS and valid certificates** in production environments
* Monitor agent status regularly in **Fleet > Agents**
* You can edit policies later to add integrations (like Windows logs, security events, etc.)
