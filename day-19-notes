# 🛡️ How To Create an Attack Diagram | Day 19

## 🎯 Objective
Create an **attack diagram** that visually maps out your plan of attack for a simulated or real-world lab environment.



## 🛠️ Tools Used
- [**draw.io**](https://app.diagrams.net/) – A free online diagram editor used to design and visualize the attack flow.



## 📐 What is an Attack Diagram?

An attack diagram is a **visual representation** of how an attacker might:
- Gain initial access  
- Escalate privileges  
- Move laterally through a network  
- Access sensitive data  
- Exfiltrate information  

It helps **SOC teams, Red Teamers, and Threat Hunters** to simulate, analyze, and defend against threats effectively.
