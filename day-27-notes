# Investigate RDP Brute Force Attack | Day 27

**Objective:**
Learn how to investigate an RDP brute force alert.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This tutorial walks you through investigating an RDP brute-force attack using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and osTicket for alert management.

---

## 🔍 Steps to Investigate RDP Brute Force Alert

### 1. **Access Kibana Alerts**

* Navigate to:
  `http://<your-elasticsearch-vm-ip>:5601`
* Go to **Security** > **Alerts**

### 2. **Investigation Methodology**

Use the following approach to analyze the brute force behavior:

#### ✅ Is the IP known to perform brute-force activity?

* Check the attacker IP on reputation sites:

  * [https://abuseipdb.com](https://abuseipdb.com)
  * [https://greynoise.io](https://greynoise.io)

#### ✅ Are other users affected by this IP?

* Go to **Discover** in Kibana
* Use a filter:

  ```
  ```

attacker-ip AND user.name:\*

```

#### ✅ Were any logins successful from this IP?
- Use this search query:
```

attacker-ip AND event.code:4624

````
- This will show successful RDP login attempts

#### ✅ What activity occurred after login?
- Check commands executed, tools installed, or files accessed.
- Review subsequent logs for suspicious behavior or privilege escalation.

## 📬 Automate Ticket Creation with osTicket

### Configure Webhook Action in ELK:

1. Go to: `Rules`
2. Choose **RDP Brute Force Rule**
3. Click **Edit Rule Settings** → **Actions** → **Webhook**
4. Configure as follows:
 - **Action Frequency:** For each alert
 - **Body Payload:**
```json
{
"name": "RDP Brute Force Alert",
"subject": "{{rule.name}}",
"message": "Please investigate the rule: {{rule.name}}"
}
````

> **Note:** Make sure your osTicket integration is already tested and working (see Day 25)

---

## 🧪 Test It

* Launch an RDP brute force attack in a controlled lab setup
* Monitor logs and alert creation
* Check ticket generation in osTicket

---

## 🛡️ Reminder

> This lab was executed in a safe and isolated environment for learning and awareness only.
