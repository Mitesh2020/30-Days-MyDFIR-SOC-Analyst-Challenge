# ⚙️ Sysmon Setup Tutorial | Day 9

## 🎯 Objective

Install **Sysmon** on a **Windows Server** and confirm that it is collecting system telemetry for security monitoring.



## 📦 What is Sysmon?

**Sysmon (System Monitor)** is a Windows system service and device driver that logs detailed information about process creation, network connections, file changes, and more—useful for threat detection and incident response.



## 🧰 Prerequisites

- Windows Server 2022 (or compatible)
- Administrator privileges
- Internet access



## 🛠️ Installation Steps

### 1. 📥 Download Sysmon

Go to the official Sysinternals download page:

🔗 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon

- Download the ZIP file
- Extract its contents (you’ll get `Sysmon64.exe` and `Sysmon.exe`)



### 2. 📥 Download Sysmon Configuration File

Use a modular and community-maintained Sysmon config:

🔗 https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular

- Download the `sysmonconfig.xml` from the repo
- Place it in the same folder where `Sysmon64.exe` is located



### 3. 📂 Prepare the Folder

You should now have:

```text
C:\Tools\Sysmon\
  ├── Sysmon64.exe
  ├── Eula.txt
  └── sysmonconfig.xml
````



### 4. 🖥️ Install Sysmon with the Configuration

Open **PowerShell as Administrator**, navigate to the Sysmon folder, and run:

```powershell
cd "C:\Tools\Sysmon"
.\Sysmon64.exe -i sysmonconfig.xml
```

* Accept the license prompt by typing `Agree` when asked

✅ If successful, Sysmon will be installed as a Windows service and will begin collecting telemetry based on your XML config.



## 📊 Verifying Installation

1. Open **Event Viewer**
2. Navigate to:

```
Applications and Services Logs → Microsoft → Windows → Sysmon → Operational
```

3. You should begin to see event logs like:

   * Event ID 1 → Process Creation
   * Event ID 3 → Network Connections
   * Event ID 10 → Process Access
   * Event ID 22 → DNS Queries
