# Command and Control (C2) Introduction | Day 18

## 🎯 Objective
Understand the fundamentals of Command and Control (C2), its importance in cybersecurity, common tools and frameworks, and an overview of the Mythic C2 platform.



## 📘 What is Command and Control (C2)?

Command and Control (C2) is a technique used by attackers to communicate with compromised systems. It allows them to:
- Exfiltrate data
- Execute commands remotely
- Maintain persistence
- Coordinate attacks



## ❗ Why is C2 Important?

- A critical phase in the **cyber kill chain**
- Enables **post-exploitation** control
- Used in **APT** attacks, ransomware, and red team operations
- Detection of C2 activity is key to identifying ongoing intrusions



## 🛠️ Popular C2 Tools and Frameworks

- **Mythic**
- Cobalt Strike
- Metasploit
- Empire
- Covenant
- Sliver



## 👀 What is Mythic?

**Mythic** is an open-source, extensible C2 platform designed for red teaming operations. It supports:
- Multiple payload types
- Web-based UI for real-time operations
- Secure communication channels
- Plugin system for custom functionality

### 🔧 How Mythic Works:
1. Setup a Mythic server (commonly via Docker)
2. Generate a payload
3. Deploy to target
4. Receive beacons and interact via UI
