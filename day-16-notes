# üìä Day 16 - Create Alerts and Dashboards in Kibana (Windows Authentication Logs)

## üéØ Objective

Observe authentication logs from a Windows Server and create alerts for failed RDP login attempts using Kibana.



## ü™™ Steps to Monitor Windows RDP Failures

1. Follow the same steps as **Day 15**, but this time for the Windows Server's logs.
2. In **Kibana > Discover**, use the following query to detect failed RDP logins:
   ```text
   event.code: 4625
````

> Windows Event ID `4625` indicates a failed login attempt.

3. Go to the **Alerts** section and click **Create search threshold rule**.

   * Use the above query.
   * Set a meaningful alert name and parameters.
4. If you want to set up detection rules in the **Security** section of Kibana (SIEM), refer to this helpful video:
   üé• [Create Detection Rules in Kibana (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/11eBIfDeZ7k?si=hhxVmtUxp73gzBR9)
5. Once set up, you‚Äôll find triggered alerts under:

   ```
   Security > Alerts
   ```

   with full event details.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

Due to the limitations of using local VMs for this lab:

* I successfully implemented **SSH brute-force detection** on the Ubuntu server.
* **RDP alert testing** on the Windows Server was not performed due to lack of external access.
