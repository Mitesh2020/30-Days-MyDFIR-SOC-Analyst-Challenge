# 🔐 Day 14 - Creating Alerts and Dashboards in Kibana

## 🎯 Objective
Create an alert and dashboard in Kibana to detect **SSH brute force attempts** based on failed login patterns.



## 📌 Key Fields for Detection
- `failed attempts`
- `user`
- `source.ip`



## ✅ Steps to Create Alert

1. Open Kibana in your browser:
```

http\://<your-elasticsearch-vm-ip>:5601

````

2. Navigate to the **Discover** section.

3. Run the following search query:
```kibana
host.ip: "<your-ubuntu-vm-ip>" AND message: "authentication failure"
````

4. On the top-right corner, click the **Save** button.

   * Give your query a meaningful title.
   * Click **Save** to store the query for alerting.

5. Click on the **Alerts** tab (next to "Inspect").

6. Click on **Create search threshold rule**.

   * Provide a **name** for the alert (e.g., `SSH Brute Force Alert`).
   * Use the same query from Step 3.
   * Test the query and **Save** the alert rule.



## ⚠️ Note

* Dashboard was not created in this step due to **local setup limitations**, where simulated SSH brute force attempts from different countries or IPs are not feasible.



## 📅 Day 13 Reference Query Used

```kibana
host.ip: "<your-ubuntu-vm-ip>" AND message: "authentication failure"
```



## 📂 Files

> *No files committed in this step — alert created through Kibana GUI.*



## 🚧 Next Steps

* Set up log generation for SSH attacks using tools like `hydra` or `Crowbar`.
* Once you have varied attack data, proceed to create a **dashboard** with visualizations on:

  * Top failed usernames
  * Source IPs
  * Attack frequency over time



## 🧠 Learnings

* Created a **search threshold alert** in Kibana.
* Understood how to identify SSH brute-force attempts using login failure patterns.
* Learned alert creation even in limited environments (local test setup).
