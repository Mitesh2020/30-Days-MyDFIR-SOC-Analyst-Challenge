# 🧠 Mythic Server Setup Tutorial | Day 20

## 🎯 Objective
Set up the **Mythic Command and Control (C2) Server** and understand how it works in a red team or adversary emulation context.



## 🧰 Prerequisites
- ✅ A fresh **Ubuntu Server** VM for the Mythic server
- ✅ An **attacker machine** (e.g., Kali Linux or Parrot OS)
- ✅ Internet access and `sudo` privileges on your server



## 🛠️ Setup Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Ubuntu Server
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
````

### Step 2: Install Required Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt install docker-compose -y
sudo apt install make -y
```

### Step 3: Clone and Install Mythic

```bash
git clone https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic
cd Mythic
./install_docker_ubuntu.sh
```

### Step 4: Check Docker Status

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
# If not running:
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### Step 5: Start Mythic

```bash
make
./mythic-cli start
```



## 🌐 Access the Mythic Web Interface

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
https://<your-mythic-server-ip>:7443
```

### Default Credentials

* **Username**: `mythic_admin`
* **Password**: Check the `.env` file inside the `Mythic` directory:

  ```bash
  cat .env | grep MYTHIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD
  ```

## 🧪 What You Learn

* Mythic server deployment
* C2 communication basics
* Command channel control
* Operator panel access



## 📌 Notes

* Parrot OS was already installed as the attacker VM, so I skipped its setup.
* Ensure port `7443` is open if accessing the server externally.
