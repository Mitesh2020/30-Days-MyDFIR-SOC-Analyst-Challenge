# 🧩 What is Sysmon? | Day 8

## 🎯 Objective

Understand what **Sysmon (System Monitor)** is, its capabilities, and how it plays a critical role in detecting suspicious activity on Windows systems.



## 🛡️ What is Sysmon?

**Sysmon** is a system monitoring tool from Microsoft’s **Sysinternals Suite**. Once installed, it logs detailed Windows events to the **Windows Event Log**, allowing security teams and SOC analysts to **detect and investigate advanced threats and anomalous behavior**.

Sysmon runs as a **Windows service** and provides visibility into various system-level activities that are not captured by default logs.



## 🔍 Key Capabilities of Sysmon

| Capability                | Description                                                                 |
||--|
| Process monitoring        | Tracks process creations, command-line arguments, parent-child relationships |
| Network connections       | Logs TCP/UDP connections, IPs, ports, and related processes                 |
| Driver & image loading    | Detects unsigned or unexpected driver and DLL loads                         |
| Thread injection          | Helps detect code injection and remote thread creation                      |
| File modifications        | Tracks file creation and changes (if configured)                            |
| Registry monitoring       | Detects key modifications (custom config required)                          |
| DNS queries               | Monitors DNS lookups made by processes (useful for detecting C2)            |



## 🧾 Important Event IDs to Remember

| Event ID | Event Type             | Description                                              |
|-||-|
| `1`      | **Process Creation**   | Logs when a new process starts, including CLI, parent ID |
| `3`      | **Network Connection** | Logs outbound TCP/UDP connections from local processes   |
| `6/7/8`  | **Driver/Image/Thread**| Logs driver load, DLL injection, remote thread creation  |
| `10`     | **Process Access**     | Detects when a process tries to access another process   |
| `22`     | **DNS Events**         | Captures DNS query logs made by local processes          |

> These logs can be viewed in **Event Viewer > Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Sysmon > Operational**



## 🔧 Why Use Sysmon?

- 🔍 Detect **malware**, **lateral movement**, **privilege escalation**, and **data exfiltration**
- 🧠 Supports **behavior-based detection**
- 🧩 Easily integrates with SIEMs (like **Wazuh**, **Elastic Stack**, **Splunk**)
- ✍️ Works well with custom rule sets (e.g., **SwiftOnSecurity** Sysmon config)



## 📌 Summary

**Sysmon** provides deep, real-time visibility into what's happening on your system beyond what traditional event logs can offer. It's a lightweight but powerful tool that helps defenders detect threats early by capturing critical system events.
