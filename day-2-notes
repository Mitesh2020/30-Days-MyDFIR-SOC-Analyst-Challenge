# 📚 ELK Stack Introduction | Day 2

A quick reference guide to understanding the ELK Stack and its benefits in cybersecurity and observability environments.



## 📦 What is the ELK Stack?

The ELK Stack consists of three main components:

- **E** – **Elasticsearch**: A distributed, open-source search and analytics engine (database) that uses `ES|QL` (Elasticsearch Piped Query Language).
- **L** – **Logstash**: A free and open-source data collection engine that gathers telemetry from various sources.
- **K** – **Kibana**: A user-friendly visualization interface to query, visualize, and manage Elasticsearch data.



## 🎯 Objective

To gain a solid understanding of the ELK Stack and the benefits it provides in a SIEM or log aggregation environment.



## ⚙️ Core Components

### 🔍 Elasticsearch
- Serves as the primary **database** and **search engine**
- Scalable and fast
- Uses **ES|QL** for powerful query chaining

### 🔄 Logstash
- Collects and processes logs or telemetry data
- Acts as a **data pipeline** to ingest from various sources

### 📊 Kibana
Kibana is used to:
- Search and explore Elasticsearch data
- Create visualizations and dashboards
- Generate reports
- Set up alerts and monitoring



## 📡 Beats – Lightweight Data Shippers

Beats are specialized agents for different types of data:

| Beat Type       | Purpose                     |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| **Filebeat**     | Log file collection         |
| **Metricbeat**   | System metrics              |
| **Packetbeat**   | Network packet capture data |
| **Winlogbeat**   | Windows event logs          |
| **Auditbeat**    | Linux audit framework data  |
| **Heartbeat**    | Service uptime monitoring   |

✅ **Elastic Agent**: A unified agent that combines all Beat functionalities into one.



## 🔁 ELK Stack vs. Splunk Comparison

| ELK Stack Component  | Equivalent in Splunk       |
|----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Elasticsearch**    | Indexer / Search Head      |
| **Logstash**         | Heavy Forwarder            |
| **Kibana**           | Web GUI                    |
| **Beats / Agent**    | Universal Forwarder        |



## ✅ Benefits of Using ELK Stack

1. **Centralized Logging** – Simplifies log collection for compliance and security monitoring
2. **Flexibility** – Supports custom ingestion and parsing
3. **Visualizations** – Enables at-a-glance observability through rich dashboards
4. **Scalability** – Easily deployable in small to enterprise-scale environments
5. **Ecosystem** – Well-supported with community plugins and third-party integrations



## 💡 Bonus Benefit

> Many modern SIEM platforms (like Wazuh, Security Onion, and SIEMonster) are built on top of the ELK Stack.  
> The more comfortable you are with ELK, the smoother your transition to other SIEMs will be.
