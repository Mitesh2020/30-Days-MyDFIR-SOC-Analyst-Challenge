# 📊 How To Create Alerts and Dashboards in Kibana | Day 22

## 🎯 Objective
Create an alert and dashboard in Kibana based on telemetry generated by the **Mythic C2** framework, specifically targeting activity by the **Apollo agent**.



## 🪛 Steps to Follow

### 1️⃣ Search for Mythic Telemetry in Kibana Discover
- Open your Kibana Dashboard (usually at: `http://<your-elasticsearch-vm-ip>:5601`)
- Navigate to the **Discover** section
- Use the following search query to detect Apollo agent execution:
```kql
event.code : 1 and winlog.event_data.OriginalFileName: Apollo.exe
````

* Save this query for use in alerts and dashboard visualizations.



### 2️⃣ Create a Custom Rule for Detection

* Use the saved query to create a custom detection rule.
* Follow this tutorial to create the rule:

### 3️⃣ Build the Dashboard with Multiple Queries

Use the following queries to create visual widgets on the dashboard:

#### ✅ PowerShell/CMD/Rundll32 Execution Events

```kql
event.code : 1 and event.provider : "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon" and (powershell or cmd or rundll32)
```

#### ✅ Network Connection Initiated

```kql
event.code : 3 and event.provider : "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon" and winlog.event_data.Initiated : true
```

#### ✅ Windows Defender Activity

```kql
event.code : 5001 and event.provider : "Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender"
```

* These help visualize behavioral telemetry associated with attacker activity.



### 4️⃣ Create a Custom Dashboard

* Use the saved queries to create visualizations like bar graphs, pie charts, and heatmaps.
* Group them under a single dashboard.
* Refer to the same video for dashboard creation:
